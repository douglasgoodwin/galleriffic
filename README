Gallerific - a jQuery plugin for photo galleries

This is a fork of Galleriffic by Trent Foley, available
under MIT license at http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic.

It hasn't been maintained since November 2009 had
some minor problems that annoyed me.

This version has a number of fixes related to jQuery 1.5.0
and bugs that might have been in the original version.

For usage information see the examples/index.html file.
